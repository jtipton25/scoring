## Scoring rules

- Lots of highly technical mathematics in the literature

- Not as much "common sense" interpretation


## Setup

- Forecaster

- Forecast

- Scoring Rule

- Goal: Develop a scoring rule so that in a competetition between forecasters, the forecasters are incentivized to forecast their true belief.

## Example: Talking heads

- Many news pundits make outrageous forecasts

    - May or may not be their true beliefs

    - Very little penalty for wrong forecast
    
    - Huge reward if outrageous forecast happens
    
- Most of these forecasts are wrong
  
    - The forecaster is not making calibrated predictions
    
    - The forecaster gets rewarded despite poor forecasting skills
    
    - The scoring rule isn't working

## Properties of scoring rules

- What properties should we want in a forecast?

- We want **forecasts that are calibrated**

    - If the weather person says there is a 50\% chance of rain, on average, there should be rain on 50\% of these days.
    
    - Weather forecasts communicated to the public are **not** calibrated
    
    - You said there was a 5\% chance of rain and it rained and I didn't have my umbrella -- You said it wouldn't rain!
    
## Properties of scoring rules

- We want **scoring rules that can distinguish between good and bad forecasters**

    - If one forecaster is better than another, does the socring rule select the better forecaster at least on average (mathematics-ese: under expectation)
    
    - Called proper scoring rules
    
    - The highest expected reward is obtained by reporting the true probability distribution

## Properties of scoring rules

- **Strictly** proper scoring rules will, on average choose the better forecast

    - Forecaster Alice forecasts a probability of 0.8 with a 90\% CI of (0.75, 0.85)

    - Forecaster Bob forecasts a probability of 0.8 with a 90\% CI of (0.70, 0.9)

    - The true value is 0.8
    
- Which was the better forecast?  

- Which forecaster has the better mean square error? Mean absolute error?

## Properties of scoring rules

- Scoring rules should not just reward **accurate** forecasts but should also reward **precise** forecasts

## Scoring rule language can sometimes be confusing

- **Probabilistic forecast:**
    - Scoring rule literature: 
        - forecasting the probability of an event happening 
        - 35\% chance of rain tomorrow
    - Bayesian forecasting literature: 
        - the forecast is a probability distribution
        - $y_t \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$
        
- **Point forecast**
    - Single valued forecasts
        - $\hat{y}_t =  2.2$

## How do we get point forecasts anyway?

- Point forecasts **start with a distribution!**

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, out.width = "90%"}
library(latex2exp)
y <- 2
alpha <- 10
theta <- 10
density_function <- function (x) {
  return(dgamma(x, alpha, theta))
}
likelihood_function <- function (x) {
  return(dgamma(y, alpha, x))
}
# layout(matrix(1:2, 2, 1))
# ## plot density function
# curve(density_function(x), 0, 4, main = "Density function", xlab="y", 
#       ylab=TeX("$\\lbrack$y|$\\theta$ $\\rbrack$"))
# text(1, 0.4, paste0(
#   "Area = ", round(integrate(density_function, 0, Inf)[1]$value, digits=2)))
# points(2, density_function(2), col="red", pch=16)
# curve(likelihood_function(x), 0, 10, main = "Likelihood function",
#       xlab=TeX("$\\theta$"), ylab=TeX("$L(y|\\theta)$"))
# text(5, 0.3, paste0(
#   "Area = ", round(integrate(likelihood_function, 0, Inf)[1]$value, digits=2)))
# points(10, likelihood_function(10), col="red", pch=16)

layout(matrix(1))
curve(likelihood_function(x), 0, 10, main = "Likelihood function",
      xlab=TeX("$\\theta$"), ylab=TeX("$L(y|\\theta)$"), ylim=c(-0.02, 0.66))
segments(3, 0, 3, likelihood_function(3))
arrows(3, likelihood_function(3), 0, likelihood_function(3))
text(3.1, -0.02, TeX("$\\theta_1$ = 3"))
text(1.5, likelihood_function(3)+ .02, TeX("$L(y|\\theta_1)$"))

segments(6, 0, 6, likelihood_function(6))
arrows(6, likelihood_function(6), 0, likelihood_function(6))
text(6.1, -0.02, TeX("$\\theta_2$ = 6"))
text(1.5, likelihood_function(6) + .02, TeX("$L(y|\\theta_2)$"))

segments(5, 0, 5, likelihood_function(5), lty=2)
text(5.3, 0.66, TeX("$\\hat{\\theta}_{MLE}$ = 5"))
```

## How do we get point forecasts anyway?

- **Consistent** scoring functions are a subset of proper scoring rules that depend on the predictive distribution through a function.

    - If the scoring rule is mean square error (MSE), the consistent function is the forecast distribution mean
    
    - If the scoring rule is mean absolute error (MAE), the consistent function is the forecast distribution median
    
- If you use maximum *a posteriori* inference in a Bayesian model, which score is consistent (and therefore proper?)    

## The problem of evaluating point forecasts

- True value: $y_t = 4$
- Forecast distribution mean: $\hat{y}_t = 3.75$
- MSE: 0.125

```{r, out.width="60%"}
layout(matrix(1:2, 1, 2))
curve(dnorm(x, 3.75, 1), from = 0, to = 8, ylim = c(0, 1))
abline(v = 4, col = "blue")
text(5, 0.45, TeX("$y_t = 4$"), col = "blue")
abline(v = 3.75, col = "red")
text(2.5, 0.45, TeX("$\\hat{y}_t = 3.75$"), col = "red")

curve(dnorm(x, 3.75, 0.5), from = 0, to = 8, ylim = c(0, 1))
abline(v = 4, col = "blue")
text(5, 0.85, TeX("$y_t = 4$"), col = "blue")
abline(v = 3.75, col = "red")
text(2.5, 0.85, TeX("$\\hat{y}_t = 3.75$"), col = "red")
```

## The problem of evaluating point forecasts

- True value: $y_t = 4$
- Forecast distribution mean: $\hat{y}_t = 2.5$
- MSE: 2.25

```{r, out.width="60%"}
layout(matrix(1:2, 1, 2))
curve(dnorm(x, 2.25, 1), from = 0, to = 8, ylim = c(0, 1))
abline(v = 4, col = "blue")
text(5, 0.45, TeX("$y_t = 4$"), col = "blue")
abline(v = 2.25, col = "red")
text(2.5, 0.45, TeX("$\\hat{y}_t = 2.25$"), col = "red")

curve(dnorm(x, 2.25, 0.5), from = 0, to = 8, ylim = c(0, 1))
abline(v = 4, col = "blue")
text(5, 0.85, TeX("$y_t = 4$"), col = "blue")
abline(v = 2.25, col = "red")
text(2.5, 0.85, TeX("$\\hat{y}_t = 2.25$"), col = "red")
```

## Problem with point forecasts

- Proper scoring rules on point forecasts measure **calibration**

- **Sharpness** is important when evaluating a forecast

- Ideas for measuring sharpness?
